This repository contains a simple microservice-based application deployed across two Virtual Machines using Oracle VirtualBox.
One VM hosts a REST API service (server.js) and the other VM runs a client program (client.js) which communicates with the API over a private network.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate inter-VM communication using a Host-only network.
